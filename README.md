# **Graph Drawing**

The project consists of a graph drawing program.

The root directory **gdw/** is composed of the following:

 * **modules/**: contains the project modules.
 * **samples/**: contains sample graphs stored in text files.
 * **Makefile**: set of instructions to clean the project.
 * **README.md**: general information about the project.
 * **draw.py**: main executable script.

The project is intended for **Windows** and **GNU/Linux**. Besides, the
